		<h1>  BUSINESS PLAN</h1>
		<p class="A">
			
			Strengths:
			Uniqueness.
			Lots of sponsors.
			Sophisticated technology.
			No bugs in our software.
			Long lasting robots.
			Good line of recipes.
			<hr>
			Weaknesses: 
			It’s big and heavy so it’s hard to move around and may discourage customers.
			Costly to make.
			The nitinol in the machine is hard to manufacture.
			Lots of graphene in chips .
			<hr>
			Opportunities:
			Little competition in this industry No one has come close to developing our software.
			Large market.
			Media/press would love our robot.
			Top chefs are sponsoring us.
			<hr>
			Threats:
			Maybe China will steal and copy our products.
			Media/press won't  love our robot.
			Changing customer attitudes towards our products.
			Low economic development.
			Our robot would be good that chefs will lose their job.
			<hr>
			Long term growth: 
			In the next ten years, our company plans to expand our company to different countries and improve our chefferys. We are planning to improve the weight of Cheffery making it lighter so it is easier to carry around to places. In the next few years we will expand the Cheffery company to outside the United States and to the United Kingdom and France. We will continue to use our sales money to update and improve Cheffery and program new food recipes from the top chefs into Cheffery and make higher quality meals.
			<hr>
			Cheffrey is a robot that is dedicated to making quick high quality and nutritious meals from recipes by the top chefs from all around the world. It only costs $499.99 and can be controlled from it’s app to make food within 15 minutes.
			<hr>
			Operation:
			To attract more customers, Cheffery is making an advertisement that explains how Cheffery works and why it is useful. Another way Cheffery will bring in more customers is a sale. For a short amount of time, Cheffery will be up to 40% off the retail price of $499.99. Recently the company has added more high quality recipes into Cheffery from chefs. Our factories take place around the United States in places such as Michigan and Idaho.
